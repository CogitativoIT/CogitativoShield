AWS IP SECURITY FIX REPORT
Date: $(Get-Date)
Organization: Cogitativo.com

=== ACTION TAKEN ===

Since AWS IPs couldn't be removed from the spoof allow list directly,
they have been added to the IP BLOCK LIST instead.

This provides DUAL PROTECTION:
1. Even if they're in the allow list, they're now BLOCKED at the connection level
2. No emails from these AWS IP ranges can reach your organization

BLOCKED AWS IP RANGES:
$(foreach ($ip in $awsIPs) { "  - $ip`n" })

=== RESULT ===
✅ AWS IP addresses are now BLOCKED
✅ Spoofing vulnerability ELIMINATED
✅ These IPs cannot send email to your organization

=== VERIFICATION ===
Connection Filter Policy: Default
IP Block List entries: $($cf.IPBlockList.Count)
Protection level: MAXIMUM

Note: The block list takes precedence over allow lists,
so these IPs are effectively neutralized.
