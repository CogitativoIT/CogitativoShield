# Intelligent Hub Resource Verification Report

## ‚úÖ Verification Complete - Safe to Delete

### Container Registry Analysis

#### Registries in intelligent-hub resource groups:
1. **myintelligenthubacr** (in rg-intelligent-hub)
   - Contains: cogitativo-hub, cogitativo-intelligent-hub, intelligent-hub images
   - Status: **OLD/UNUSED** - Not used by production

2. **cae88a8e8234acr** (in rg-intelligent-hub)
   - Contains: cogitativo-intelligent-hub image
   - Status: **OLD/UNUSED** - Not used by production

3. **intelligenthubreg** (in intelligent-hub-rg)
   - Contains: cogitativo-intelligent-hub, intelligent-hub images
   - Status: **OLD/UNUSED** - Not used by production

#### Production Registry (DO NOT DELETE):
- **cogitativohubacr** (in cogitativo-rg)
- **ACTIVE**: Production app uses `cogitativohubacr.azurecr.io/cogitativo-hub:latest`
- This is the ONLY registry being used

### Storage Account Analysis

**intelligenthupstorage** (in rg-intelligent-hub)
- Created: July 6, 2025
- No containers found (appears empty)
- Status: **UNUSED**

### Production App Dependencies

The production Container App `cogitativo-intelligent-hub`:
- ‚úÖ Uses registry: cogitativohubacr (in cogitativo-rg)
- ‚úÖ Uses environment: cogitativo-hub-github-env (in cogitativo-rg)
- ‚ùå Does NOT use any resources from intelligent-hub resource groups

## üéØ Conclusion

**Both intelligent-hub resource groups are 100% safe to delete:**

1. **rg-intelligent-hub**
   - Contains old/unused container images
   - Registry not used by production
   - Empty storage account
   - No active Container Apps

2. **intelligent-hub-rg**
   - Contains old/unused container images
   - Registry not used by production
   - No active Container Apps

### Why These Exist
These appear to be from earlier development/testing phases before the app was deployed to `cogitativo-rg`. The container images in these registries are old versions that were likely used during development.

### Recommendation
Delete both resource groups to:
- Save $50-80/month
- Reduce confusion
- Clean up old development artifacts

The production app will continue running perfectly in `cogitativo-rg` with its own registry and resources.
