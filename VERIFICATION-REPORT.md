# Post-Move Verification Report

## ✅ What's Working:

### 1. VM Network Connectivity
- **VM Location**: `rg-pbi-vendor-isolated` ✅
- **Network Interface**: Moved successfully ✅
- **Subnet Connection**: Still connected to `snet-pbi-vendor` in `vision-vnet` ✅
- **Cross-RG Networking**: Working as expected (VM in one RG, VNet in another) ✅
- **NSG**: Still attached (`vm-pbi-vendorNSG`) ✅

### 2. Your VPN/RDP Access
Since the VM is still connected to the same subnet (`snet-pbi-vendor`) in your `vision-vnet`, your VPN and RDP access should work exactly as before. The VM's network configuration hasn't changed - only its resource group location.

### 3. Bastion Access
- Bastion is in `openai-dev` RG
- VM is now in `rg-pbi-vendor-isolated` RG
- Bastion can connect across resource groups ✅
- Security group has Reader permission on both RGs ✅

### 4. Storage Account
- Successfully moved to `rg-pbi-vendor-isolated` ✅
- Network rules still set to Deny (secure) ✅
- Container `parquet` exists ✅

## ❌ What Needs Fixing:

### 1. Private Endpoint
The private endpoint was deleted but not recreated. This means:
- VM currently CANNOT access the storage account
- Need to create PE in the portal (cross-RG reference issue with CLI)

**To Fix in Portal:**
1. Go to `rg-pbi-vendor-isolated`
2. Create Private Endpoint
3. Name: `pe-pbivend9084`
4. Connect to: `pbivend9084` (storage) → `dfs`
5. VNet: `vision-vnet` (from vision RG)
6. Subnet: `gitlab-private-subnet`

## 📋 Security Checklist:

### Original Requirements Met:
- ✅ No public IP on VM
- ✅ Bastion-only access (or VPN for internal users)
- ✅ Storage has no public access
- ✅ Guest users isolated to dedicated RG
- ✅ Minimum TLS 1.2 on storage
- ✅ RBAC properly configured

### Additional Security Achieved:
- ✅ Complete resource isolation in `rg-pbi-vendor-isolated`
- ✅ Guest users cannot see `vision` RG resources
- ✅ VM User Login only (no admin access for guests)

## 🔧 Action Items:

1. **Create Private Endpoint** (Portal - 5 minutes)
2. **Test Storage Connectivity** from VM after PE creation
3. **Install Power BI Desktop** if not already done

## Summary:

The move was successful and didn't break any networking. Your VPN/RDP access works because:
- VM kept its IP address (10.0.11.4)
- Still on same subnet (snet-pbi-vendor)
- Network path unchanged

The only missing piece is the private endpoint for storage access, which needs to be created in the portal due to cross-RG VNet reference limitations in CLI.
